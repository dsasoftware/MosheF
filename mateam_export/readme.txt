1. Sample XML Create two sample export_definition xml files. 
    (export_bankinfo.xml, export_invoice.xml)
     each one has three or four fields. 
     the bankinfo should have the data grouped by one of fields.

b. Module: Create module that adds menus per xml files and configurable names 
     in that or other xml file. ('bank info' , 'invoice per period')

c.  Menus: Add action that actually exports those xml files for any filtered view. 

d.  Docs:  create a third export_explained export_explained xml 
same as export_banking with the following commented out <!--...  remarks:
 *  All the available fields that I can potentially use for the XML.
    Or:  If its in the ODOO Studio: Explain how to see them and choose them. 
 *  Documentation before each section saying :   Here you define this or that
 *  Documentation for each field:  Field of so and so.
